                    <h2>Site Intent</h2>
                        <p>There’s a lot of music out there, and it’s easy to get into this habit of only attending shows for bands or musicians with which we’re familiar. Where’s the curiosity? The discovery of new sounds? That open spirit often associated with music?</p>
                        <p>Lotus is a localized live music discovery app designed to help you find live shows, with a specific focus on a user’s defined location.</p>
                        <p>My goal is to create a modern, responsive design with easy navigation and semantic markup. The new design will allow visitors to easily get directions. The new design will also make it easy to see upcoming events and bands playing locally.</p>
                     
                    <h2>Core Functionality</h2>
                        <p>Allows users to easily have access to all nearby artists/bands show times and locations. Users can also filter search fort the artists they are searching for and purchase tickets at supporting locations.</p>

                    <h2>Be the first to know about concerts</h2>
